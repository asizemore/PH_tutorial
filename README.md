# PH_tutorial
An introductory tutorial for those looking to run persistent homology with Greg Henselman's Eirene software.

# Day 1 tutorial
We'll be using data from https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ to practice running persistent homology. 

To get set up for running the Day 1 tutorial, please add the following packages:
JLD
Eirene
Combinatorics
SparseArrays
Plots
LightGraphs
GraphPlot

To install packages, either switch to the package handeler in julia with ']' and then type 'add PackageName' or load in the Pkg package
handler with 'using Pkg' and then type 'Pkg.add("PackageName")' to add any package.
